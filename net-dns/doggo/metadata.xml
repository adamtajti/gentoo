    doggo is a modern command-line DNS client (like dig) written in Golang.
    It outputs information in a neat concise manner and supports protocols
    like DoH, DoT, DoQ, and DNSCrypt as well.

    It's totally inspired by dog which is written in Rust. I wanted to add
    some features to it but since I don't know Rust, I found it as a nice
    opportunity to experiment with writing a DNS Client from scratch in Go myself.
    Hence the name dog + go => doggo.
